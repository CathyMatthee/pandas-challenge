This repo contains the PyCitySchools folder which contains the Jupyter notebook for the LGA school performance and Resources folder.
- There are two notebooks:
    - PyCitySchools_starter is simply a copy of the starting code and what the assignment should look like. It has been used as a backup file as well.
    - PyCitySchools_Analysis is the final notebook for submission. Although both notebooks should be okay.
- Resources folder contains two .csv files which contains the data that was analysed:
    - schools_complete
    - students_complete
